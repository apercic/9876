# 9876

The aplication is in two git repositories:

server-side: https://github.com/apercic/9876/tree/development

client-side: https://github.com/apercic/6789/tree/development

\
Pull the code with git clone and run 'mvn clean install' in both directories.

The jar for the server is in directory: \9876\target\demo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar\
The jar for the client is in directory: \6789\target\game-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar\

First run the server with 'java -jar demo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar'\
Then open two terminals and run 'java -jar game-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar' in both.\
(this mimics the two players)
